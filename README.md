This project aim to analyze diabetes data and address some important business problems/questions.

This project is focused on Exploratory Data Analysis and Model Training using Python. The project train the data using Logistic Regression Model and Rondom Forest model  and compare the results.
A notebook is shared for the analysis.

Problem Statement:

Diabetes is one of the most frequent diseases worldwide and the number of diabetic patients are growing over the years. The main cause of diabetes remains unknown, yet scientists believe that both genetic factors and environmental lifestyle play a major role in diabetes.

A few years ago research was done on a tribe in America which is called the Pima tribe (also known as the Pima Indians). In this tribe, it was found that the ladies are prone to diabetes very early. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients were females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage. Here, we are analyzing different aspects of Diabetes in the Pima Indians tribe by doing Exploratory Data Analysis and building a classification Model.

Dataset attribute Information:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
Blood pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml) test
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable (0: the person is not diabetic or 1: the person is diabetic)


Steps for Pima diabetes Date Analytics:

Import the nesessary libraries ,Dataset explorations, checking the missing values in the date frame. Screening of variables, Study the  relationship of variable. The project train the data using Logistic Regression Model and Rondom Forest model  and compare the results.
